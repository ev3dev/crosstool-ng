 Files found in patches/*/ are available under the same license as the
 upstream software they apply to.
 .
 That means that you can't use those patches if you were licensed the
 software under a specific license which is not the one the software is
 commonly available under.
 .
 As an example, if you ever managed to get the Linux kernel under a license
 other than the GPLv2, you are not allowed to use the Linux kernel patches
 coming with crosstool-NG, as those are available under the GPLv2, which is
 the license the Linux kernel is most commonly available under.
 .
 As a convenience, the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) v2.1 (for the
 patches against glibc, uClibc, and some other libraries) is available there:
